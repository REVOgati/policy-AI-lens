For free hosting with Google Sheets integration, here's the best approach:

Recommended Setup:

Google Sheets Integration (Phase 3) - Do this first:

Use Google Sheets API (free)
Set up Service Account credentials
Store credentials securely (not in repo)
Free Hosting Options:

Backend: Render.com (free tier, supports Docker, auto-deploys from GitHub)
Frontend: Vercel (free, optimized for React/Vite, auto-deploys from GitHub)
Alternative: Railway (free trial), Fly.io (free tier)
Docker: Yes, use it because:

Render/Railway support Docker deployment
Ensures consistent environment (dev = production)
Makes switching platforms easier
Next Steps in Order:

✅ Set up Google Sheets API & credentials
✅ Implement Google Sheets storage in code
✅ Create Dockerfile for backend
✅ Deploy backend to Render
✅ Deploy frontend to Vercel

---------------------------
1. Code edits; extract registration number, and have manual contact input before calendar reminders and ensure entire workflow from upload to sheets is final and preferred

2. Production (dockerize production and setup) || & Go over docker and answer common questions, understand commands e.t.c, ensure it is understandable comprehensively

3. Project should store to sheets and create calendar reminders (Work on Apps Script both locally and production)


4. Ability to search and extract by vehicle registration, name or expiry date(format normalized) and display user friendly

5. Automated whatsapp texts? day before expiry at 9am OR automated listing to George of calls to make today including last premium...sent on gmail?

6. Packageability to ensure ease when using over phone e.g shortcuts, UI for uploads and UI for searching e.t.c

7. Upload to upwork and other Automation forums and channels : Reach up to 100 people diverse

8. Connect with automated receipt generetor and maybe send to relevant whatsapp numbers automatically??: based on different items (needs to be versatile for motor(comp, tpo, annual , monthly, bikes, lorries, e.t.c..medical, bussineses..e.t.c - User selects "Do you want to generate and send receipt for this? "))

9. Plan on next phases: Automated quotation generator e.t.c
